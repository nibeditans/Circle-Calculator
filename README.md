# Circle-Calculator
This Circle Calculator is a simple Python script that allows users to calculate the area and perimeter (circumference) of a circle given its radius. This tool is ideal for educational purposes, quick mathematical calculations, or as a base for more complex geometrical computation programs.

## Features
* **Calculate Area:** Computes the area of a circle based on the provided radius.
* **Calculate Perimeter:** Computes the perimeter (also known as the circumference) of a circle using the radius.

## Requirements
Python 3.12.1 
(Version can differ)

## Installation
No installation is required. Ensure you have Python installed on your system to run the script.

## Usage
To use the Circle Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Download the circle_calculator.py script from this repository.
3. Open your command line or terminal.
4. Navigate to the directory where you saved circle_calculator.py.
5. Run the script using Python by typing the following command:

   python circle_calculator.py

6. Follow any on-screen instructions (currently, the script is pre-set to calculate the area and perimeter of a circle with radius 7.5).

## Example:
After running the script, you should see the following output if using the default radius of 7.5:

    Radius of the circle:  7.5
    Area of the circle:  176.625
    Perimeter of the circle:  47.1

## Customization
To calculate the area and perimeter of a circle with a different radius, modify the circle_calculator.py script. Change the value of 7.5 in the line c1 = Circle(7.5) to your desired radius.

## Example:

    c1 = Circle(10)  # Replace 10 with your desired radius
